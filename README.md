# missile_simulation_matlab
Missile simulation Matlab code
Simulates the trajectory of 7 different missiles each with their own starting parameters:
Initial position in X0, Y0, Z0 coordinate (m), Initial mass and landing mass: m0 and mf (kg), Initial thrust magnitude Thmag0 (N), and Direction angle (degree): theta, phi
  
 Project was completed as part of an Introduction to Matlab course at UC San Diego in the winter quarter of 2016.
